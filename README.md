**Project:-** AI Training Data Management System  
  
**Project Overview**  
  
To train AI models, our customer, an AI developer, uses web scraping to gather publicly accessible data. But they have two major obstacles to overcome:  
**1. Keeping Questions and solutions Separate:-** Before developers receive the solutions, they should be able to evaluate their understanding by responding to questions. This facilitates learning and self-affirmation.  
**2. Maintaining Fair and Balanced Data:-**  To produce AI models that are accurate and fair, the training data must be varied and devoid of bias.  
  
**Assumptions and Validations**  
  
1. Finding relevant data takes less time when material is well-structured and indexed.  
**Question:** Does automatic categorization speed up the process of finding relevant training data for developers?  
2. Developers are encouraged to independently verify their understanding when answers are delayed.  
**Question:** Does delayed access to answers improve the self-assessment process and learning outcomes?   
3. By improving search performance, tagging enables developers to find particular training materials more rapidly.  
**Question:**Are tags an effective tool for simplifying searches and reducing retrieval time?  
4. AI algorithms that have been trained on impartial, balanced data perform better and are more equitable.  
**Question:**Do AI models trained on rebalanced datasets outperform those trained on imbalanced data?  
5.  Dataset enhancements are streamlined through real-time bias identification and reporting.  
**Question:**Are the bias reports easy to interpret and actionable for developers?  
6. Compliance to the CCPA and GDPR guarantees moral AI development and steers clear of possible legal problems.  
**Question:**Are access control measures adequate in preventing unauthorized use of sensitive training data?  
  
**Functional Requirements**  
  
**1. Question Classification:**  
**Feature:** Training questions are automatically categorized into specific categories according to topic and level of difficulty.  
**Result:** During training,developers can quickly find particular questions.  
  
**2. Question and Answer Separation:**  
**Feature:** Keep the solutions in an area with restricted access. Until developers verify that they have tried the query, answers are displayed.  
**Result:** Encourages self-evaluation and makes sure developers use their knowledge before finding answers.  
  
**3. Method of Tagging:**  
**Features:** Allow questions to be tagged with keywords (e.g., themes, difficulty levels).  
**Result:** Developers are able to browse and filter training materials based on their own requirements.  
  
**4. Finding Bias and Rebalancing Data:**  
**Feature:** Put algorithms in place to automatically rebalance the data and detect biases in the dataset.  
**Result:** Assures that training data is impartial, varied, and appropriate for all use cases.  
  
**5. Bias Reporting in Real Time:**  
**Feature:** Instantly notify users when biased or unbalanced data is found and offer fixing suggestions.  
**Result:** Enables developers to quickly raise the level of training.  
  
**6. Lawful Compliance Structure:**  
**Feature:** Includes safeguards against noncompliance with data privacy laws such as the CCPA and GDPR.  
**Result:** Reduces legal risks and guarantees moral AI development.  
  
**System Requirements**  
  
**1. Indexed Data Structure:** It is important to optimize a database structure to enable quick searching of tags and questions.  
**2. Controlled Answer Access:** A feature that requires user confirmation before displaying responses should be implemented by the system.  
**3. Both automated and manual tagging:** AI-generated tags ought to be able to be manually improved by developers.  
**4. Dashboard for Bias Analysis:** A user-friendly interface should show bias metrics along with recommended remedial measures.  
**5. Biased Data User Alerts:** When biases or imbalances are found, users should be notified automatically.  
**6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Only individuals with permission should be able to alter data.  
  
**Preliminary Tasks**  
  
1. **Clarifying and finalizing requirements:**  
 * Complete the specific criteria by conducting seminars and client interviews.  
 * Record every expectation that the client has for the system.  
2. **Strategy for Gathering and Preparing Data:**  
 * Describe a plan for gathering and preparing a variety of excellent training data.  
 * During data collecting, make sure that ethical and data privacy rules are followed.  
3. **Design of the System Architecture:**  
 * Create a system-wide blueprint that is both scalable and maintainable.  
4. **Framework for Tagging and Categorization:**  
* Create a schema that allows questions to be tagged according to topic, level of difficulty, and other criteria.  
* Put in place automated and configurable classification systems.  
5. **System for detecting bias and rebalancing data:**  
* Create methods to efficiently detect and rebalance biased data.  
* Make actionable suggestions and bias alerts in real time.  
6. **Respect for Data Privacy Laws:**  
* Include provisions that guarantee that data usage conforms with the CCPA and GDPR.  
* Perform routine audits and compliance inspections.
